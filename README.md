# Java Hotel Information System
Project for course **"Object Oriented Programming 1"**. The project was divided into 3 parts, which helped to understand what an object model is and why it is useful to have it before implementing any of the functionalities. 

The system supports 4 roles: receptionist, room cleaner, administrator and guest. Each role has unique options, all supported by the app. For example, a receptionist handles reservations, as well as check-ins and check-outs, while administrator can CRUD any other entity as well as see useful reports on the hotel's bussiness.

**Swing** was used for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Only for a few frames was _Window Builder_ used, all others were hardcoded.
