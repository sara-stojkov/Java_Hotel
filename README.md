# Java Hotel Information System
Project for course **"Object Oriented Programming 1"**. The project was divided into 3 parts, which helped to understand what an object model is and why it is useful to have it before implementing any of the functionalities. 

The system supports 4 roles: receptionist, room cleaner, administrator and guest. Each role has unique options, all supported by the app. For example, a receptionist handles reservations, as well as check-ins and check-outs, while administrator can CRUD any other entity as well as see useful reports on the hotel's bussiness.

**Swing** was used for creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Only for a few frames was _Window Builder_ used, all others were hardcoded.

## Motivation

This project was a great way to learn the basic pillars of OOP - inheritance, encapsulation, polymorhpism and abstraction. 

Learing how to structure classes and the actual app has been really helpful so far. This app helped me see how an actual project timeline will look.
